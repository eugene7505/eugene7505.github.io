<h3><b>About</b></h3>
<p class="p7">
I am an engineering manager at Twitter leading an ML recommendations domain. We build embeddings for retrieval at various product surfaces and provide them as ranking features. Previously, I was an ML engineer at Pure Storage where we use ML to help customers project and simulate storage workloads. Before Pure Storage, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the TerraSwarm Research Center, where I utilized Discrete Event Control theory and formal method for policy synthesis to enforce privacy under certain utility constraints.

</p><p class="p5">I earned my Ph.D. degree in August 2014 in <a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/systems/"><span class="s2">EECS Systems Laboratory</span></a> (EE:S) at the University of Michigan, where I was working in the Discrete Event Systems (DES) group supervised by Prof. St√©phane Lafortune. After my graduation, I joined the TerraSwarm Research Center.
</p><p class="p5">
        My research interest lies at the intersection of control, formal synthesis, and network security.
        Specifically, center to my research is a privacy notion called "opacity" formulated with automata models.
        Opacity means the impossibility for an outside attacker to derive the true value of the secret in a given system.
        My work explores algorithmic methods for designing and controlling systems that guarantee the desired opacity specifications.
        
 In my PhD thesis, I address the verification and the synthesis of systems that preserve privacy, from the viewpoint of DES.
 My PhD research primarily focuses on the control and synthesis of secure networked systems in the formulation of Discrete Event Systems. I use automata models and use language/state representations to capture the desired specifications, and develop algorithmic procedures that automatically control the system to be secure.
 Specifically, based on the use of automata models, my work involves in constructing models, characterizing desirable privacy specifications, developing verification algorithms and enforcement algorithms to achieve the desired privacy specifications.-->

        <i> Jun. 2011 - Present </i> <br>
        In this project, we propose a new control mechanism that enforces opacity by inserting fictitious events and developed insertion generation algorithms that provably enforce opacity. We have also solved for an optimal insertion function that minimizes the overhead cost from fictitious inserted events using a game theoretical approach.

    <li><span class="s3"><b>Fault-Tolerant Discrete Control Logic in Automotive Applications</b></span> <br>
        <i> May 2011 - Present </i> <br>
        In this project, our goal is to use discrete event control theory to analyze automotive applications.
        We are lucky to have the demo system of passive entry/start systems from TRW Automotive. 
        By constructing automata models from the C source code, we want to automatically identify live-lock/deadlock situations in the source code.
        Collaborating with several undergraduate students and , we have applied abstraction techniques to overcome the state space explosion problem, developed a new composition rule that better captures the behavior of the source code, and implemented optimized algorithms  
    
    <li><span class="s3"><b>Verification of Opacity Privacy Properties in Discrete Event Systems</b></a></span> <br>
        <i> Sep. 2009 - Nov. 2011 </i> <br>
        Opacity is a privacy property that characterizes whether or not an intruder can infer a given secret of the system based on its observations. 
        In this project, we study opacity in the discrete-event level of abstraction. 
        Current-State Opacity (CSO), Initial-State Opacity (ISO), Language-Based Opacity (LBO), and Initial-and-Final State Opacity (IFO) are concerned. 
        We have proposed a more efficient method for verifying ISO and a developed polynomial time reduction between each pair of opacity notions. 
        We have also extended opacity notions to "Joint-Opacity" in coordinated architectures and have developed the verification algorithms. </li> </p>
